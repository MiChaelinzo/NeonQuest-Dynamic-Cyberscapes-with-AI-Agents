# Requirements Document

## Introduction

NeonQuest transforms the static Neon Underground Unity package into a self-adapting cyberpunk playground through AI-driven environmental logic. The system uses Kiro's agent hooks to procedurally generate dynamic layouts, lighting, and ambient effects that respond to player behavior in real-time. This creates an immersive environment where corridors reshape themselves, neon signs react to movement, and atmospheric elements shift contextually, ensuring every gameplay session feels uniquely alive and reactive.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the environment to dynamically reshape itself as I move through it, so that each exploration feels fresh and unpredictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player moves through a corridor THEN the system SHALL procedurally generate new corridor segments ahead of the player's path
2. WHEN a player backtracks to a previously visited area THEN the system SHALL maintain spatial consistency while allowing for subtle variations
3. WHEN the player reaches a junction point THEN the system SHALL generate multiple path options with contextually appropriate layouts
4. IF the player remains stationary for more than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL introduce subtle environmental changes to maintain engagement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want neon signs and lighting to react to my presence and movement, so that the environment feels alive and responsive to my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player approaches within 5 meters of a neon sign THEN the sign SHALL increase in brightness or change flickering patterns
2. WHEN a player moves quickly through an area THEN ambient lighting SHALL surge or pulse in response to movement speed
3. WHEN a player stops near interactive elements THEN nearby lights SHALL dim or brighten to create focus
4. IF environmental lighting changes occur THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth transitions over 1-3 seconds to avoid jarring effects

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want atmospheric elements like fog density and ambient sounds to shift based on game context and time, so that the mood evolves naturally during gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in-game time progresses THEN fog density SHALL gradually shift between predefined atmospheric states
2. WHEN the player enters different zone types THEN ambient drone sounds SHALL transition to match the area's character
3. WHEN specific gameplay events occur THEN the system SHALL trigger coordinated changes across lighting, fog, and audio
4. IF multiple atmospheric changes are triggered simultaneously THEN the system SHALL blend them smoothly without conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be driven by declarative YAML specs, so that I can modify environmental behavior without hard-coding changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environmental rules are defined in YAML specs THEN the system SHALL load and apply these rules at runtime
2. WHEN a spec file is updated THEN the system SHALL hot-reload the changes without requiring a full restart
3. WHEN invalid spec configurations are detected THEN the system SHALL log clear error messages and fall back to default behavior
4. IF spec files contain conflicting rules THEN the system SHALL apply a defined precedence order and warn about conflicts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro agent hooks to monitor player behavior and trigger procedural changes, so that the environment can react intelligently to player patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN player position changes are detected THEN agent hooks SHALL evaluate trigger conditions for environmental changes
2. WHEN player movement patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL adjust procedural generation parameters accordingly
3. WHEN mission time thresholds are reached THEN hooks SHALL trigger appropriate environmental state transitions
4. IF hook execution causes performance issues THEN the system SHALL implement throttling to maintain target framerate

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Neon Underground assets without breaking their structure, so that the procedural system works seamlessly with existing prefabs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Neon Underground prefabs are loaded THEN the system SHALL preserve their original mesh and material configurations
2. WHEN procedural generation occurs THEN the system SHALL use asset references rather than duplicating asset data
3. WHEN assets are instantiated procedurally THEN the system SHALL maintain proper parent-child relationships and transforms
4. IF asset integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback placeholder objects and log detailed error information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the system to maintain smooth performance during real-time generation, so that environmental changes don't impact gameplay fluidity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN procedural generation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain minimum 60 FPS on target hardware specifications
2. WHEN multiple environmental systems are active simultaneously THEN CPU and GPU usage SHALL remain within acceptable thresholds
3. WHEN memory usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL implement object pooling and cleanup strategies
4. IF performance drops below acceptable levels THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce generation complexity or frequency
